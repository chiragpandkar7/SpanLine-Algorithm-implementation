## OpenGL C++ Project with Bezier and Hermite Curves

This project is a Qt-based C++ application that utilizes OpenGL for computer-aided geometrical design (CAGD). The implementation includes classic algorithms such as Bezier and Hermite curves for efficient rendering.

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the implementation of CAGD algorithms using OpenGL within a Qt C++ application. It provides a foundation for drawing Bezier and Hermite curves with high efficiency and accuracy.

## Features

- **Bezier Curve**: Implementation of the Bezier curve drawing algorithm.
- **Hermite Curve**: Implementation of the Hermite curve drawing algorithm.
- **OpenGL Rendering**: Utilizes the power of OpenGL for efficient and hardware-accelerated rendering.
- **Qt Integration**: Designed as a Qt project for cross-platform compatibility.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- C++ compiler compatible with your development environment.
- Qt framework installed on your system.
- OpenGL development libraries.
